Owner 2026-09-17: first workspace implementation is Git-backed worktree/path allocation; non-Git
workspace adapters remain an extension boundary. Worktree separation is never the sandbox security proof.
Host refactor kit lives in `.agents/` and is development tooling, not a runtime or Enterprise module.

The package and gate sections below describe the current implementation. The 2026-09-17 owner amendment
records the accepted target and its transition work in PLAN.md. Target decisions are not implemented gates:
arch.json and the current source layout change together in that work. Existing WIP and proof are preserved.
scripts/lint-arch.mjs enforces the current machine rules; historical decisions remain in the log.
No baseline or silent exception is introduced; rule changes remain explicit and versioned.

## Owner amendment — 2026-09-17 (accepted target, implementation pending)

Authority: Alperen's live acceptance of the consolidated Fable/Astra review, with database, sandbox/worktree,
module/version and conditional Go clarifications. This amendment supersedes conflicting target language below;
historical proof and current gates retain their measured scope. PLAN.md tracks the transition, not completion.

### Product, packages and dependencies

- Customer-installed product: personal computer, team server, on-prem, customer-hosted remote and air-gapped.
  No vendor-operated SaaS tenancy requirement. Core carries principal/scope/resource/policy context end to end;
  Enterprise maps customer identity, tenant, RBAC/RLS and governance into those contracts.
- Development is in deckent-next. Public deckent receives only the completed Core distribution. Proprietary
  Enterprise sources/packages remain separately controlled from their first implementation, consume public Core
  APIs and are excluded from public source, history and package artifacts. Core installs without Enterprise.
- Target responsibility layers: platform, domain, capabilities, engine, adapters, surfaces. Domain is pure:
  it can depend on pure contracts/types, never config/filesystem/database drivers. Engine owns application
  transitions and ports; adapters implement ports. An explicit composition root imports and wires adapters.
  Existing kernel/providers/runtime/orchestration packages migrate only after a reviewed mapping and stable WIP.
- Tiers (core/base/enterprise/custom/user) describe distribution and extension; they do not grant authority.
  Security policy can narrow permissions; a user override cannot relax a mandatory organization deny.
- Every transition has one owner. Existing shared legacy services are port inputs, not presumed absent.
  Brain plans/evaluates/accepts; deterministic scheduling dispatches eligible work; independent Auditor checks;
  Nervous observes and requests bounded recovery. They do not become competing state writers.
- Legacy Goal/Mission/Flow/Run/WorkItem/Attempt/Operation names are evidence for responsibility analysis,
  not identities to migrate or alias. Define new task-centered contracts; do not impose the old hierarchy.
  An agent persona does not grant privileges. Learning is required product scope, not a deferred legacy folder.
- TypeScript Core is retained. Go may own measured execution responsibilities through a versioned supervisor
  port when total complexity/resource/reliability evidence justifies it. No duplicate scheduler, approval or
  acceptance authority, and no automatic full-Go rewrite. Application daemon and supervisor are distinct roles.
- Accepted size policy: 1,500 lines maximum per file including native C; 800 is a design target, not a second
  hard ceiling. Current 800-line gates remain until FOUNDATION updates their scope and settings coherently.
  No silent native exemption. Variable product policies/catalogs are data; protocol constants and safety
  invariants are explicit versioned code contracts. Unit cohesion matters beyond the existing 4,000-line budget.

### Task-centered execution — owner checkpoint 2026-09-17

- Task represents the work. `run` executes a directives-defined workload; `do` admits natural-language,
  AI-produced or structured work; `autonomous` periodically performs/monitors admitted tasks and processes.
  Mission coordinates goal-bounded cycles of run/do/autonomous, sequentially or in parallel.
  These entry/coordination semantics do not authorize separate schedulers, policy engines or state writers.
  Task/coordination identities require a new contract; no legacy identity migration or compatibility aliases.
- Task kind describes the work domain, independently of execution entry, scheduling and permission.
  Owner examples: code, routine, daily and purchase. Exact canonical IDs remain a contract decision.
  Use versioned modular definitions/profiles for personal/team/Enterprise use; future purchase refinements
  (internal/external, etc.) can extend the domain without multiplying execution engines. A daily preset
  may propose a schedule; the actual schedule is explicit and separately validated. Kind grants no authority.
- A separate `process` execution surface is a candidate for deferral, not a deleted business capability.
  The initial surface proposal uses run/do/autonomous under Mission; revisit process only for a demonstrated gap.
  The old deckent_style enum mixes work unit and execution semantics and is not the target ontology.
- Legacy is reference only for capabilities, learned invariants and design gaps. Implement new contracts.
  No legacy command/config/value aliases, compatibility parser or migration burden is admitted (owner correction).
  Historical source inventories are evidence, not acceptance criteria for old names or defaults. Future version
  evolution of the new product remains required; it does not imply support for the legacy format.
- Previous 500-worker/10k-task numbers were scale illustrations, not release promises or global limits.
  Initial local working scenario: approximately 6–8 parallel workers and at most 50 tasks in the admitted workload.
  Workload size, ready queue, active workers, provider/tool quotas and evaluation throughput are separate budgets;
  enterprise ceilings follow deployment resources and evidence, not those local example numbers.
- First end-to-end business integration: IFS ERP. Owner has test environments for IFS Cloud and Applications 10.
  Cloud is the preferred MCP integration candidate and is being prepared; MCP availability/authorization is not yet
  proven. Applications 10 also participates through a native connector path where MCP is unavailable/unsuitable.
  Both paths consume the same typed business operations, scope, approval, result/effect and recovery contracts.
  Native means a direct supported integration adapter, not a requirement for Go or direct database writes.
  Actual API/transport/auth and first business scenario remain to be verified against the supplied environments.
  No connector is claimed implemented. Developer dogfood remains a separate later acceptance scope.
- Core owns storage ports and security guarantees. Individual database-adapter commercial packaging remains
  an explicit distribution decision; do not infer the edition from database brand or capability alone.

### Product data layout — owner 2026-09-17

- Development/dogfood and customer installations use the same product data layout: one project/installation
  `.deckent` root owns persistent brain/memory, tasks/runs, locks, approvals, audit, artifacts and ERP state.
  Source code and external host products' own configuration are outside this product-state contract.
- One versioned path registry/resolver derives logical resource locations from validated config and scope;
  modules never assemble their own root, sibling `.brain`, `.tasks`, or arbitrary temporary directory.
  Root relocation is configuration, not per-consumer branching. Persist resource IDs/relative references;
  active operations keep a resolved layout revision so config changes cannot split one run across roots.
- Terminal/Desktop and other surface-local cache/session/scratch use declared platform-local runtime/temp
  locations with scope, permissions, owner and retention. Durable jobs/decisions never rely on temporary files.
  Actual locations are inspectable from the shared CLI/SDK/MCP path-query contract; no surface-specific truth.
- Remote database/blob storage remains supported: `.deckent` contains configuration references, manifests and
  inspectable logical locations, not secret plaintext or an unsolicited mirror of every remote ERP record.
  External systems of record remain external. Workspace/worktree allocation is a separate managed resource.
- FOUNDATION defines the layout; CONTRACT versions resolver and inspection; STORE/ISOLATION implement/test
  relocation, containment, symlink rejection, concurrent locks, crash cleanup and secret permissions. Existing
  legacy stores/keys are not moved/deleted. Current BRAIN_HOME/global-scope behavior is not target completion.

### Deterministic storage and customer data access

- Product-state operations (Run, Attempt, Approval, reservations, receipts) are typed domain operations.
  LLMs neither generate their queries nor choose transactions, credentials, database routing or retry policy.
- Keep execution state, memory records, vector search, audit/events and artifact storage as separate ports.
  An index may be rebuilt from canonical records; it is not an independent approval or Run-state authority.
- Resolve installed storage modules from schema-validated effective config and a capability registry once per
  configuration generation. JSON/YAML, if supported, are parsers into the same schema and precedence chain.
  IDENTITY.md is descriptive context, not connection, permission or infrastructure-selection authority.
  Config contains secret references, not credentials. Active operations retain their resolved binding/revision.
- Each port selects its admitted adapter (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB or another implementation). Dialect and
  driver differences remain inside adapters; domain/engine contain no scattered `if dbstack` query branches.
  Package selection and capabilities are data; unsupported guarantees fail with a typed explanation.
- SQL values use bound parameters. Identifiers/operators/order fields come from validated schemas/allowlists,
  not value placeholders or string interpolation. Document queries use validated typed filters; no arbitrary
  operator, JavaScript expression or unvalidated aggregation is accepted from a model/user.
- Customer business-data requests may use an LLM to propose intent or a constrained query plan. Deterministic
  code validates schema, principal/scope, field access, operation permissions, cost/row/time limits and required
  approval, then compiles the plan through the connector. Prefer domain operations for writes; raw-query tools,
  if admitted, are separate privileged capabilities, never the internal state-store path.
- Adapter manifests declare actual transaction/isolation, conditional-update, ordering, pagination, streaming
  and cancellation capabilities. Probe deployment prerequisites; selecting MongoDB does not prove transaction
  support, and PostgreSQL isolation levels are not interchangeable with SQLite locking.
- Bound connection pools, write queues, in-flight requests and result sizes. Parallelize independent operations
  within resource/scope limits; serialize conflicts at the relevant resource or aggregate. SQLite contention,
  serialization conflicts and network failures have explicit typed handling, not one generic retry loop.
- Retry only classified safe operations with bounded attempts/deadlines and idempotency or conditional writes.
  An unknown commit outcome requires reconciliation; retries do not repeat untracked external side effects.
  Admission accounts for query/deadline budgets; cancellation requests do not prove a remote write was undone.
- A state transition and its outbox record share a transaction where required. Cross-store changes use explicit
  durable coordination/reconciliation, never pretend atomicity. Scope applies to queries, caches, vector filters,
  artifacts and logs; customer RLS is an additional enforcement mechanism, not the whole boundary.

### Workspace, sandbox and effect isolation

- A Git worktree separates working trees/indexes; it shares repository metadata/objects and is not a security
  sandbox. Workspace projection (worktree, independent snapshot/copy, direct workspace) and execution realm
  (host process, container, VM or remote) are separate resolved axes of one execution posture.
- The resolved posture binds attempt identity, owner generation, base revision, resource capabilities,
  filesystem mounts, network policy, secret access, CPU/RAM/PID/disk/time budgets and effect/landing policy.
  Direct execution remains explicit and policy-admitted; unavailable isolation never silently becomes direct.
- Untrusted workers do not receive writable main-workspace or shared Git administrative paths. A trusted
  workspace broker materializes the permitted view and mediates Git mutations; snapshots/copies are used where
  shared metadata would violate the threat model. Read-only source and bounded outputs are independent choices.
- Separate attempt workspace, temporary files, caches, credentials and scoped data. Containers are adapters,
  not proof of isolation: mounts, privileges, network and secret exposure must be verified in each environment.
- Resource/side-effect conflicts (same branch, file, CRM record or deployment) are scheduled explicitly beyond
  the task dependency DAG. Staged outputs bind to the tested base and artifact digest. Verify before landing;
  serialize/fence the landing, detect a changed base, and revalidate the integration result before acceptance.
- Cancel, crash and disconnect preserve evidence and uncertain effects. Stop only owned processes/resources;
  cleanup has retention and ownership rules. Discarding a worktree cannot undo an external API/DB operation.
  Those effects need idempotency, reconciliation or an explicitly supported compensation action.
- Proof covers sibling/main-workspace access, symlink/path escape, shared metadata, secrets/network, concurrent
  landing, stale ownership, cancel/restart and partial effects on the supported platform/realm matrix.

### Modules, protocol and version compatibility

- Module manifests identify version, public API/port versions, dependencies, required capabilities, config schema,
  migrations, distribution and provenance. Composition validates the graph before activation; no core deep imports.
  Optional modules load only when selected. An enabled security module failing cannot silently disable enforcement.
- Resolve and record a reproducible module/config generation; drain affected work before incompatible changes.
  A dependency version range is checked at install/admission; it is not permission to update active work silently.
- Version packages, wire protocols, config/data schemas and native ABI independently. Breaking public contracts
  require an explicit compatibility/migration policy; protocol handshake rejects unsupported capability versions.
  TS/Go messages derive from a shared schema; compatibility tests cover supported old/new client/daemon/worker pairs.
- Schema evolution has backup/restore, exclusive migration ownership, expand/contract where applicable and an
  explicit rollback floor. Installing an older binary is not a rollback after an incompatible data migration.
- Legacy successes and known bugs are separate acceptance inputs. HMAC authenticity is not an asymmetric
  signature. Exactly-one accepted terminal record does not promise exactly-once arbitrary external effects.
- Capacity figures (10k tasks, 500 workers) are illustrative, not fixed acceptance thresholds. Baselines precede language choice;
  runtime and real-provider evidence remain separate. No delivery date is inferred from catalog-port throughput.
- Early dogfood requires a stable N controlling candidate N+1, bounded real work, independent acceptance,
  cancel/restart evidence and an external recovery path. Product self-development cannot bypass its own policy.

## Packages (current implementation)

```text
src/platform/       config, errors, i18n, identity, host paths, shared metadata and utilities
src/adapters/       provider configuration and credential validation
src/surfaces/       CLI parsing/rendering and public surface API
src/composition/    executable wiring: selects adapters, then invokes the CLI surface
```

`domain`, `capabilities` and `engine` are declared dependency boundaries for upcoming contracts and
execution; their runtime capabilities are not implemented by the directory map. Domain cannot import
platform or other packages, host modules or ambient host globals. This static guard does not prove
all possible semantic purity. The current adapter registration is wired only by composition.
Surfaces may consume platform/domain/capabilities/engine, never adapters. Engine may consume
platform/domain/capabilities; adapters implement ports and may consume engine contracts. Composition
wires all layers. New package names have no compatibility import aliases.
Current executable: `dist/composition/core/cli/internal/entry.js`. The unimplemented MCP binary
is not advertised; its contract and composition entry arrive with the real MCP surface.

`apps/*` import only `surfaces`. Cross-package imports target the package `index.ts` and nothing else;
`internal/` is package-private.

## Package contract

- Public API is `index.ts`; everything else is internal.
- Every configured text source file ≤ 1,500 lines (eslint + lint-arch; 800 design target), functions ≤ 150 lines (warning).
- Package line budgets and the total budget live in `arch.json` (`budgets`); growth past a budget is a
  design decision, not a lint fix.
- Mechanism code is string-free: user-facing text comes from `kernel/core/i18n/locales/{en,tr}/*.json` through `t('key')`.
  Keys are literals (lint), catalogs have identical key sets (lint), surfaces never print literals (lint).
- Config field values live in `kernel/core/config-fields`; `config-literal` uses source-derived
`scripts/config-vocabulary.json` with freshness checks before lint/build.

Model, provider and flow identifiers appear only in `providers/core/registry/` (lint).
- The product writes markdown only through `kernel/core/docs-authority`, and only `DECKENT.md` plus a bounded
  section in `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. No README/CHANGELOG/vision/sprint-log writers exist.
- Every environment: Linux, macOS, Windows native, Windows WSL, Docker. A platform without proof reports a
  typed `UNSUPPORTED`/`DEGRADED`, never a silent fallback.
- State lives under the project's `.deckent/` (v2 schemas) and `.brain/memory.db` (FTS5); both gitignored.

## Testing policy

- `tests/contracts/<package>/` — public API and invariant tests only; no internal-function tests.
- `tests/e2e/` — real binary journeys (`doctor`, `run`, `start`, `do`, …) on fixture projects under `tests/fixtures/`.
- `tests/golden/` — normalized outputs of deterministic commands, captured from the legacy binary and
  diffed against the new one during the port.
- Budget: ≤ 8,000 test cases total, every test file ≤ 1,500 lines (lint; 800 design target). Legacy invariant titles are in
  `tests/contracts/HARVEST.json`; each port card lists which titles it honours.

## Documents

The Markdown gate admits four documents: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`;
≤5-line pointers `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`; `.deckent/docs/core-memory/*.md`;
and the explicit refactor host-kit globs in `arch.json`: the remaining 23 `.agents/skills/<skill>`
directories/references plus `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules`, `.codex/rules`.
The host kit is excluded from product distribution (`package.json files`: dist/native/assets/README/LICENSE).
Product code still writes no Markdown; owner-maintained host instructions are a development-only exception.
Design reasoning goes into the decision log below, not arbitrary new documents.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-16 | Clean-room port into this repository instead of in-place refactor of the legacy codebase (587k lines, 24.8k-line spawn backend, 40.9k tests, 5,535 path-keyed lint baselines). | Every in-place move broke 8+ gates and preserved dead code; the owner chose deletion over archive. |
| 2026-09-16 | File size is a mechanical gate (800 lines) in addition to cohesion-based boundaries. | Cohesion alone did not hold: one file tripled in two weeks. Supersedes legacy ADR-D-006 §2 wording. |
| 2026-09-16 | Layer direction `kernel ← providers ← runtime ← orchestration ← surfaces`, observability read-only, public-API-only imports. | Carries the legacy ADR-D-004 invariant (lower layers never import upward) into named packages; the legacy graph had only 138 violations out of ~3,400 edges, half of them caused by the i18n catalog living in cli. |
| 2026-09-16 | Spawn backends, exact-docker custody, effects and locks are `runtime`, not orchestration. | They were consumed only by orchestration but lived in core/orchestra with a 24.8k-line monolith; a runtime package with a `SpawnBackend` façade of 17 methods is the contract (legacy ADR-G-014). |
| 2026-09-16 | Zero hardcoded model/provider/flow identifiers outside `providers/core/registry/`. | Legacy ADR-G-036; enforced by lint instead of a ratchet. |
| 2026-09-16 | Memory is DB-first (`.brain/memory.db`, FTS5) and the only legacy state imported verbatim; all other `.deckent` state is v2 with a one-shot `import-legacy-state`. | 80 schema constants and 7 SQLite files could not be kept byte-compatible through a rewrite (legacy ADR-G-035 kept; rest re-declared). |
| 2026-09-16 | The product no longer writes README/CHANGELOG/vision/release/sprint-log or host rule files. | Document sprawl was partly product-generated; the owner removed the feature. |
| 2026-09-16 | Windows native custody is ported and wired (`runtime/custody/win32`), reported `DEGRADED` until CI proof. | Legacy had an unreferenced 1.8k-line win32 adapter: support that only appeared to exist. |
| 2026-09-16 | K1: top-level `schema_version: 2`; kernel owns selection/identity/presentation fields and config IO. Package sections register strict Zod schemas and optional authored-layer validators before resolution. Provider limit policy is owned by `providers/core/contract` and registered by CLI ingress. | Prevents another god-config and keeps parent quota authority outside generic deep merge. Unknown top-level keys are preserved with warnings; registered sections reject unknown fields. |
| 2026-09-16 | K1: defaults → platform-global (legacy fallback) → project → env → exact `$DECK:` references; global writes target the platform path. Migration uses an exclusive writer lock, revision checks, private atomic writes and three retained backups. | IO failures never quarantine healthy files; dry-run performs no writes. Provider selections default to null until an authored selection or provider policy resolves them. |
| 2026-09-16 | K1: preserve the 81 legacy error codes and their gaps; freeze registry authority, validate it at CLI startup, localize messages/remedies and centralize exits 0/1/2/78 and emission. `doctor` reports `scope: kernel` in this card. | Config/host proof must not claim provider/native/runtime readiness before their cards. K1 shares the locale resolver with the upcoming K2 catalog port. |
| 2026-09-16 | ARCH tiers gate: every package uses data-driven `core ← base ← enterprise ← custom ← user` tiers and ≤4,000-line units with `index.ts` + `internal/`. Package indexes compose shipped core/base; future enterprise/custom/user units must load lazily through edition/policy ingress. `tiers.enforce=true`. | Unit imports and tier direction are checked without a baseline. Kernel config defaults register from base into a core extension seam. Provider credential env literals are confined to the provider registry. |
| 2026-09-16 | K1 review B1: runtime retains resolved secrets with RFC 6901 provenance; `config get` masks paths (including provider projections) and sensitive keys before selecting/formatting output, and filters string values through `redactSensitive`. | Human and JSON views must never expose resolved `.deck` credentials. |
| 2026-09-16 | K1 review B2: writer lock uses an exclusive directory plus private `owner.json` (pid/hostname/nonce/time); legacy file locks remain readable. Dead local owners and >10-minute malformed/unpublished local locks recover with a typed warning; live, permission-denied and foreign owners HOLD. Nonempty generation tombstones remain after atomic rename; empty unpublished directories use atomic `rmdir`. | Deterministic retained destinations fence delayed reclaimers from moving a newer live lock; age alone cannot prove a valid process on another host dead. Errors carry path/pid/age. Tombstones are recovery evidence, not ordinary-write artifacts. |
| 2026-09-16 | K2 mechanism: ten JSON families per locale, immutable validated registry, JSON-derived `MessageKey`, static manifest import for per-key floor defaults, and one locale resolver. No generated-file size exemption. | Preserves the 800-line rule and removes top-level await/Node dependencies from the renderer-facing translation unit. Legacy membership follows Fable's exact K2 list: 3,374 retained and 607 excluded; the 46 protected keys remain. K1's config.invalid moved to config.valueInvalid to preserve the legacy contract. |
| 2026-09-17 | Owner accepted consolidated architecture review with deterministic storage, separate workspace/sandbox axes, modular composition and version compatibility; TypeScript retained, Go conditional. | Target amendment above; FOUNDATION and successor rows in PLAN.md track implementation. No runtime/gate completion inferred from this decision. |
| 2026-09-17 | Refactor host kit tracked; owner exception; product still writes no markdown. | Exact host-kit globs plus pointers/core-memory match the gate; disabled skills excluded and host kit not shipped. |
| 2026-09-17 | Task-centered work; run/do/autonomous execution, goal-bounded Mission, modular task kinds; IFS ERP first business integration. | Cloud MCP candidate plus Applications 10 native-adapter proof; local 6–8 workers/up to 50 tasks is a workload scenario, not a system ceiling. Historical names/semantics do not override this decision. |

Decision 2026-09-17: pure config-fields SSOT + source-derived literal gate (REVIEW1323); unified .deckent product-state root accepted, implementation tracked separately.

| 2026-09-17 | FOUNDATION/A: 1,500 source lines maximum, 800 design target; native C/Go and application sources included. | Owner size amendment; Fable PASS1340. Historical HARVEST evidence exception is one exact file path. |

| 2026-09-17 | Config stores references; injected SecretResolver retrieves values per load without effective-secret caching or plaintext secret-file reads. | PATH-LAYOUT/A+B, Fable PASS1349; OS keyring backend remains unimplemented. |

FOUNDATION/B accepted in Fable REVIEW1357: platform/adapters/composition package mapping and read-only CLI path query. Domain boundaries declared; execution is not implemented.

PATH-LAYOUT/C accepted in Fable REVIEW1358: project `.deckent/config.json` is the fixed locator, `layout.root` selects data root, and inspection exposes both. No recursive discovery or implicit migration; effective operation/crash layout propagation remains follow-up.

CONTRACT/A accepted: pure task graph admission and dependency readiness. Dependency readiness is not dispatch/resource/policy admission; canonical Task acceptance is required.

CONTRACT/B accepted: versioned attempt evidence and application transitions. Attempt evidence never accepts a Task; cancellation intent is separate from terminal process evidence. Durable journal and real supervisor are separate scopes.

STORE/A implements an attempt application service, typed store port and lazily selected SQLite adapter. Snapshot and receipt commit atomically with scoped replay/CAS. Production ingress, guarded path composition, contention policy and worker/pool isolation remain unimplemented; synchronous Node24 SQLite is an experimental baseline.

CONTRACT/C preserves exact termination cause (exit code or signal) and separates stale evidence from conflicting evidence. Version1 wire identities share a256-code-unit bound; content/task descriptions are not constrained by this ID bound. Dependency blocking is direct, with no implicit terminal cascade.
